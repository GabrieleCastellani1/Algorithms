## Algorithms and Data Structures

This project aims to give an implementation of some basic data structures and sort algorithms, with a simple visualization in pure Swing. For learning purposes. The project is developed following the Model-View-Controller pattern.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains one folder by default:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources

Inside this folder there are four sub-folders:
- `logic`: the folder with logic classes, all the logic of the data structures implemented is in these classes 
- `graphics`: the folder with classes dedicated to display a visualization for the structures and some basic animations
- `util`: the folder with util classes, shared among all classes
- `enums`: the folder with enum classes, shared among all classes

## Dependency Management

There are no external dependency, all plain Java 17.
